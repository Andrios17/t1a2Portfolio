                <p>This project was completed after one week of beginning at Coder Academy. It was done to
                    consolidate knowledge and to mainly practice the intricatcies of the CSS flexbox model. The stack that was 
                    used in this project includes both HTML5 and CSS. This project has provided me with a great starting point to continue improving my
                    front-end skills. It has also provided me with a nifty solution to quickly connect with future professionals
                    and clients in the industry!

                <p>This project was completed as course material in Coder Academy. 
                    The main aim of this project was to enhance skills utilising different positioning
                    techniques such as absolute positioning, fixed positioning, and relative positioning to create
                    six concentric circles each containing a width of 50 pixels. The stack that was used to complete
                    this project includes both HTML5 and CSS. This project has allowed me to sharpen my CSS skills
                    and begin thinking like a front-end developer!

                <p>Althought it might not like anything special, this project has fully enhanced my CSS capabilities. 
                    Completed as part of my learning at Coder Academy, this project provided me with an opportunity to test 
                    my skills of CSS effects & Animations. From utilising and altering psuedo classes, to the implementation
                    of keyframes, this project acted as a capstone to the web development component of my course. The stack utilised
                    includes HTML and CSS.
