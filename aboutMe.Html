                        with the hard skills developed throughout my time at Coder Academy, I am a well rounded individual
                        who will not only produce high quality work which has been completed with high attention to detail,
                        but will also be an asset to any work environment I am placed in. I am highly proficient in both HTML and CSS,
                        and will be delving deeper into back-end languages to become a well rounded developer!</p>

                            text in my project designs, my career path has taken many twists and turns. I have
                            been working in the law industry for the past 5 years but have finally made the plunge
                            to transition into an indsutry I have always had a desire to work in. Having this prior experience
                            will allow me to bring my highly developed soft skills of superior attention to detail, people skills,

                        <p>Earlier this year, I have begun my studies in a Higher Education Diploma at Coder Academy and I couldnt be more 
                            excited! I have begun to develop superior skills in front-end markup languages such as HTML5 and CSS. I have also 
                            However, more importantly, my mindset has altered to so I am able to start thinking like a web developer. Although
                            the passion for tech has always been there (I built my first PC at the age of 12!), it has fostered into a huge part
                            of my life! p.s I still do save time to watch my beloved Knicks

                        <p>I have undertaken this journey to work as a full-stack developer who has a passion for 
                            user-design and user-exprience. The process of building something from scratch and following
                            its development from the start to the end has always excited me. Contributing to meaningful
                            projects that are a joy for the user to interact with is my ultimate end goal.
